I would like to thank my supervisor at Andritz Hydro AB Mikael Helin for providing me with the subject of this thesis, and for his guidance and experience to help me develop the final product. I would also like to thank Tobias Marten at Andritz Hydro AB for taking his time to answer my questions and guiding me in the right direction. Finally, I would like to thank Per Isaksson at Uppsala University for taking his time to read my thesis and quickly providing me with feedback.
